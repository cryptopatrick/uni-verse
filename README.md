> "A faint trace of something."

A tiny project strictly aimed at learning and practice fundamental Ai techniques that can be used to create services around text documents, related to university scholarships, policy documents, and  research applications.

Ideas so far:

+ Research how to digitize and modernize a university's paper-based archive of scholarships
and turn them into a digital database of scholarships, making it searchable by students.
+ Digitize a school's policy documents so that a chatbot can chat to them.
+ Create a service that simplifies the process, and improves the quality, of writing research applications.
+ Describe a process for transfering information from physical form (for example, handwritten documents) over to digital form.
+ Describe a process on how to curate raw text data, tag and structure its
information, in order to improve its searchability, and for an Ai to use the information.
+ Develop an Ai-based service that uses tagged and digitized data, created by following a formal processes.
